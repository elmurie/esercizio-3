# webpack-chunks-starter
webpack starter: chunk splitting, dynamic imports, scss, images and fonts src-to-dist copy

Simple setup of webpack 5 to achieve:
 - chunks splitting and runtime creation
 - dynamic js modules import example (in order to load js and scss just if needed)
 - scss availability
 - dev with maps, prod with minification
